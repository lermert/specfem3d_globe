# This version of Specfem3D Globe
Gridded crustal models from ambient noise tomography are included in the East Asian / Japanese region in order to assess their viability compared to each other and crust1.0 when compared to shallow earthquakes.
The gridded models are prepared using their original model files and python scripts import_MODELNAME.py and then simply read in during meshing (providing values to compute_element_properties routine). During preparation, models are smoothed and the model domain is filled in with values from crust 1.0. The Moho is also supplemented from crust1.0 as these models mostly come without a constrained moho.

# Specfem3D Globe

Program specfem3D from `SPECFEM3D_GLOBE` is a 3-D spectral-element solver for the Earth.
It uses a mesh generated by program meshfem3D.
